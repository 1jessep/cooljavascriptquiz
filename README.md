# cooljavascriptquiz

Hi my name is Jessep Stynchcomb and this is my submission for the Module 4 Challenge. Students were asked to create a quiz from scratch using mainly javascript.
The quiz is meant to test the user's knowledge of Javascript. However my submission is not 100% complete. I am having trouble using local storage to display
the user's initials/highscores on a separate page. 

the link to the deployed webpage can be found here:

Attached is a screenshot of the quiz.
